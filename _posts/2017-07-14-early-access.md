We have opened up the site to start sending early access invitations. You can find the link to sign up [Stay With Nomads](https://www.staywithnomads.com/?s=blog). Our early access users are critical to us. They are the ones that will shape the site with their feedback.

Included in the invitation is a small five question survey to find out more about where and how long our users currently stay when traveling. This data will help us define defaults behaviors and make sure we cater to everyone's lifestyle. If we get enough people participating in the survey, we will also release the results to the public.

The next release we will be adding the ability to add places you would be interested in living. Selecting your interests is the first step to start organizing your coliving space. We will be talking more about this in our next blog post.

**Thanks for your interest in StayWithnNomads!**
