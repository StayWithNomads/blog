We are about to release our first significant feature for [StayWithNomads](https://www.staywithnomads.com/?s=blog). üöÄ This feature is, in our opinion, the first step needed to take to find your group for your self-organized coliving space.

As part of the signup process, the user will now select places they would like to or plan on traveling in the future. With this data, we will be able to show the user a news feed of activity based on their interested places. Also, this allows people to see how many other people are interested in that location, providing some validation on how successful a coliving space would be.

The part that took us the longest with this feature would be deciding how we should display all of our places. We decided on a combination of a search/autocomplete and just a big list of all of the places we have divided by region/subregion/country and for the bigger countries divided by state/providence.

### Preview of selecting your interests

We will be looking for **your feedback** on how we can improve displaying and selecting the places. üëç

To give feedback, we will be showing a survey link at the end of the signup process. Once again this is just a short five question survey but this time asking more out the user experience.

**Thanks for your interest in StayWithNomads!**
