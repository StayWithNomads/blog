### The Idea

StayWithNomads is an application to help digital nomads find and create self-organized coliving spaces around the world. For example, you could find a beautiful six bedroom AirBnB, and if you could find five other people to colive, with you could split the cost, and it would end up costing less than a typical one bedroom hotel or Airbnb.

The hardest part of this is finding the other people to join you, even if you are lucky and have five friends that are visiting the same location the same time as you. The person organizing is stuck paying upfront for the space and then trying to collect payments from the friends. With StayWithNomads, we are hoping to fix all these problems.

### Releasing Features

Let's talk about the way we are developing the application. To build an application that fits your needs, we feel like it is best to design and release the features in small parts. This gives us time to listen and implement your feedback to create the best user experience. With that being said, if you log onto the site during the early access stage, the features may still be in the prototype stage but this is the perfect opportunity for you to get in and give feedback.

### How Can You Help?

Besides providing feedback, the biggest thing right now is to help spread the word about this project. For the project to work, we need to create a great community of digital nomads.
