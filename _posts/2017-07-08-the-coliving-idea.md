### The Idea

StayWithNomads is an application to help digital nomads find and create self-organized coliving spaces around the world... For example, you could find a beautiful 6 bedroom AirBnB, and if you could find 5 other people to colive with you could split the cost, and it would end up costing less than a normal 1 bedroom hotel or Airbnb.

The hardest part of this is finding the other people to join you, even if your really lucky and have 5 friends that are visiting the same location the same time as you... The person organizing it is stuck paying upfront for the space and then trying to collect payments from the friends. With StayWithNomads, we are hoping to fix all these problems.

### Releasing Features

Let's talk about the way we are developing the application. In order to build an application that fits your needs, we feel like it is best to build and release the features in small parts. This gives us time to listen and implement your feedback to create the best user experience. With that being said if you log on to the site at the start, the features may still be in the prototype stage but this is the perfect opportunity for you to get in and give feedback.

### How Can You Help?

Besides providing feedback, the biggest thing right now is to help spread the word about this project. For the project to work, we need to create a great community of digital nomads.
